# weather-tracker

This app was designed to let you get he current weather forecast for a specific city you search for. 
when you load the page you can then enter the city you want to search.
upon searching for the city you are presented with the citys temp, time, and wind factor.
unfortunatly i wasnt able to code in the 5 day forecast or the uvindex. i hope to come back and work on this.
below is a demo gif of how the app works.
